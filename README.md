# Cluster Analysis with PyCaret
This Python script performs cluster analysis using different clustering techniques, including K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Birch Clustering. It utilizes the PyCaret library for clustering and visualization.

## Setup
### Requirements
* Python 3.2.0<br/>
* PyCaret library

Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pycaret


## Script Overview
The script performs the following tasks:

1. Installation of PyCaret library.
2. Importing necessary libraries and datasets (Jewellery dataset from Pycaret library).
3. Setting up parameters for the clustering models.
4. Performing cluster analysis using different clustering techniques.
5. Visualize the clustering results using various plots, including an elbow plot(to check the number of appropriate clusters), silhouette plot, and distribution plot.

## Assignment Overview
The following tasks are performed in the assignment:

1. The clustering is performed for different algorithms in the notebook.
2. After this, tables are formed for each algorithm based on scores of different no. of clusters (c=3,4,5) on different parameters(normalization,transformation etc).(attached CSV files)

-The plots, graphs, etc. are in the notebook for better visualization.

## Additional Notes

* The dataset used in this script is the Jewellery dataset, which is found in Pycaret library under clustering datasets.
* Different preprocessing techniques such as normalization, transformation, and PCA are applied to the data before clustering.
